Example 2 : How to create table with same structure without data?

Answer: Create table Student_Replica as Select * from Student where 1=2;
-Due to the condition 1=2, the aforementioned query will construct the same table as student titled "Student Replica" without any data. The user can generate duplicate table structures without data by performing the aforementioned query because the condition 1=2 indicates True=False, which is always a False condition.

Example 4 : How to fetch first 5 highest marks with Student table.

Example 6 : How to find the duplicate row count from specific table.
Answer:Select Employee_no, count (Employee_no) from Employee Group by Employee_no Having count (Employee_no)>1 Order by count (Employee_no) desc;
-In addition to grouping by and having, we also need to use the Count function. Additionally, you must employ order by clause.

Example 8 : How user can display following structure with using single SQL Query.

Example 16 : How to find out manager name and employee name from same table.
Answer:Select e.employee_name,m.employee name from Employee e,Employee m where e.Employee_id=m.Manager_id;
-To retrieve the records from the table in this query, the user is utilizing a self join.
A query that joins (compares) a table to itself is called a self-join. When comparing values in one column to other values in the same column in the same table, self-joins are employed. Getting running counts and running totals in a SQL query is one use case for self-joins. Create the comparison, rule out instances where a certain value would be identical to itself, and select from the same table that is specified twice with different aliases before writing the query.
