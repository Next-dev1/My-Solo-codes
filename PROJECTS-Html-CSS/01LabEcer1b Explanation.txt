1. getNum(): This is a getter method. It returns the value of the private integer variable num. In this code, it is used to get the value of num from the LabExer1B object.

2. setNum(int num): This is a setter method. It sets the value of the private integer variable num to the value of the parameter num. 
In this code, it is used to set the value of num in the LabExer1B object.

3. main(String[] args): This is the main method of the program. It follows the standard structure of a Java program. First, it creates an instance of the LabExer1B class. Then, 
it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. 
It prompts the user to enter an integer, and then it uses the setNum method to set the value of num in the LabExer1B object to the entered integer. 
Finally, it calls the showNumberPlus10, showNumberPlus100, and showNumberPlus1000 methods to display the sum of num and 10, 100, and 1000, respectively.

4. showNumberPlus10(int num): This method takes an integer as a parameter and displays the sum of the parameter and 10.

5. showNumberPlus100(int num): This method takes an integer as a parameter and displays the sum of the parameter and 100.

6. showNumberPlus1000(int num): This method takes an integer as a parameter and displays the sum of the parameter and 1000.

In the main method, the showNumberPlus10, showNumberPlus100, and showNumberPlus1000 methods are called with the value of num as the argument. 
This means that the methods will display the sum of num and 10, 100, and 1000, respectively.
